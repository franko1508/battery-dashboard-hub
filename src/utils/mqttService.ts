/**
 * In a production environment, you would implement a real MQTT connection

 * 
 * 1. Use AWS IoT Device SDK to create a connection:
 *    const mqttConnection = mqtt_connection_builder.mtls_from_path({
 *      endpoint: AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT,
 *      cert_filepath: certificate_path,
 *      pri_key_filepath: private_key_path,
 *      ca_filepath: root_ca_path,
 *      client_id: "your-client-id",
 *      ...
 *    });
 * 
 * 2. Connect and publish:
 *    await mqttConnection.connect();
 *    await mqttConnection.publish(topic, message, mqtt.QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE);
 * 
 * Since this is running in a browser environment, we would need a different approach:
 * - Use a proxy service/API Gateway to handle the MQTT connection
 * - Use WebSockets for MQTT over WebSocket
 * - Use an MQTT broker service that supports browser clients
